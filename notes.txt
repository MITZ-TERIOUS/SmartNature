New ideas:
show the actual angle number somewhere when rotating plot
show the actual dimensions somewhere when resizing plot
maybe have bottom bar on garden screen with add plot, etc.
show a shadow of old copy of plot when editing current copy

TODO:
adding new polygon
parsing encyclopedia(s)
not using more than one encyclopedia source (maybe add options?)
sharing gardens
voice commands
add dimensions to gardens/plots
pinch and zoom for editview
add alternate plot list view for gardens

Current issues:
what do when a plot completely overlaps another? introduce z-index?
dotted circle might be obscured in edit mode
button bar might obscure plot after "reset zoom"
