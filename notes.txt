New ideas:
show the actual dimensions somewhere when resizing plot
show a shadow of old copy of plot when editing current copy
maybe have different hint when garden is empty

TODO:
what if user repeatedly presses search ex. encyclopedia, find garden?
making sure app works without internet/camera/etc.
make plant screen look better
add ability to lookup species through plant screen and remember chosen result
add long click context menus
add dimensions to gardens/plots
add alternate plot list view for gardens
going back into edit polygon mode?

Current issues:
handle cases when device feature is missing
photo filenames depend on garden name staying constant
what happens when user uploads garden with same name+city+state
afraid share garden activity might end before it's finished
zoomfit when polygon point mode?
what to do when a plot completely overlaps another? introduce z-index?
dotted circle might be obscured in edit mode
