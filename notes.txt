New ideas:
maybe have add plot on bottom bar on garden screen
what about simply clicking plot in edit mode to toggle rotate mode?

TODO:
adding new polygon
resizing plots
sharing gardens
parsing encyclopedia(s)
not using more than one encyclopedia source (maybe add options?)

Current issues:
Bad plot size when adding plot to empty garden
what do when a plot completely overlaps another? introduce z-index?
negative angle in Quadrant IV
