CS 160 Project Smartnature

GardenGnome is an app developed on the Google Android platform targeted towards gardeners, especially those who are part of a local community garden. Users can map out their gardens including individual plots/plants and then record their progress through journal entries/pictures. Gardeners are also aided in their gardening with the online encyclopedia found in the app. Gardeners can then share their gardens with one another to track each other's progress.
